Brief Description on CSS:-

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to describe the visual style and layout of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. It provides a way to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing designers to create a consistent look and feel across a website.

With CSS, developers can apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to specific HTML elements, and create complex layouts and animations. CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them, and properties to define the visual appearance of those elements.

CSS can be written inline within HTML documents, or in external files that can be linked to multiple HTML pages. External stylesheets offer several advantages over inline styles, including easier maintenance, faster load times, and better scalability.

CSS is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being added to the language to keep up with the latest design trends and technologies.
